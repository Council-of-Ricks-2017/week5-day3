### jsWheatAndChessboard

Use a loop, or loops, to emulate the wheat and chessboard problem--
and use a conditional, or conditionals, to evaluate the output of your
solution before it is printed.



If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?
